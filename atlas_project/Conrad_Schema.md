## Schema Description (conrad_schema)

This pipeline involves performing behavioral research on mice while imaging neurons, then automatically processing the data. The pipeline begins with manually recording metadata on each mouse as described below in the `Mouse` table. Each behavioral experiment is overseen by an experimenter who's name is also manually recorded. During the actual experiment, the mouse is hooked up to a two-photon microscope and movies are taken and recorded along with relevant behavioral information in the `Session` table. 

The remaining `Behavior` and `Imaging` tables perform automatic processing on all previous tables using Datajoint's populate functionality. A series of functions are called to analyze the data and store experimentally relevant information including segmented regions of interest, extracted calcium imaging signals, and statistics of the mouse's licking behavior.
