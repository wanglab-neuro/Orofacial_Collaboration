## Neuroglancer

Neuroglancer is a web based viewer for three dimensional data. It displays cross-sectional views of image stacks and has built in features for visualizing overlain volumetric structures as meshes or segmentation cross-sections. 

Neuroglancer is used in the Active Atlas project to display histology sections with segmented structure in the brainstem region that are outputted by the pipeline itself. The viewer is a useful tool for anatomists and experimentalists as the associated brain image stacks can be seen in full quality and be easily manipulated and shared to other users. The web-based nature of the viewer allows for a straightforward and robust way to access and visualize data between collaborators.

The Neuroglancer source code is being actively edited to add and improve features to make this tool as useful and intuitive as possible. Annotation features are being added so expert neuroanatomists can annotate new brains that can be used for additional training sets used by the convolutional neural network. Structure translation/rotation features are similarly important to allow for researchers to manipulate registered structures.
